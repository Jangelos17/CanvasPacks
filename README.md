CanvasPacks by James Angelos

NOTES FOR MyMCAT:
This is a project I built simply because my friend enjoy playing fifa and I was bored.
Hope you find it somewhat interesting.
You can find the extension under the name CanvasPacks on chrome store, or on my github @Jangelos17

Current Version: 1.0

Description:
This is a small chrome extension designed for Canvas.
It displays the grade of an assignment posted to canvas like opening a FIFA Pack.
This project uses Javascript to create DOM elements and add them to the window.
Animation of elements is done using Animate.css.

Update Notes:
Version 1.0
Very basic version with main functionality being simply reading website data to find the assignments score and display the "Pack" opening with animations.
Currently displays every time the assignment is opened.
Currently only words for canvas URLs containing \_\_.instructure.com or canvas.wisc.edu

Features/Changes I plan on implementing in the future:
- Storing an grade (card) for the user to see later
- Adding functionality for more schools' canvas pages.
